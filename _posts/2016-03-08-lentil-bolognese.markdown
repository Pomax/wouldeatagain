time: 1 hour
ingredients:
  - lentils
  - carrots
  - onions
  - baby kale
  - black beans
  - canned tomatoes
  - garlic
  - salt and pepper
  - basil
  - olive oil
  - 2 or 3 red peppers
directions: |
  1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. When it's ready, add the red peppers and cook for about half an hour or so, until the outside skin is nicely blackened. To save time, you can also skip this step and use a jar of pre-roasted peppers.
  2. Meanwhile, sauté the onions, carrots, and garlic with some olive oil until the onions are translucent.
  3. Add the lentils and beans and season with salt and pepper.
  4. When the roasted red peppers have cooled, remove their skins and chop them into small pieces. Add to the sauce.
  5. Add the canned tomatoes and leave the sauce to simmer.
  6. If you want, add the sauce to the oven to give it a nice roasted flavour. Make sure you are using an oven-safe pot or dish such as a dutch oven.
  7. Add baby kale and chopped basil right before serving.

This is a variation on a great winter pasta sauce, but unlike the ground meat based original, it's packed with fibre. To give this an extra punch of roasted flavour, I like to to make this in a dutch oven so I can stick in the oven for awhile before serving.

 If you eat dairy, you can also try adding parmesan cheese and a touch of crème fraîche to add a bit of richness.
