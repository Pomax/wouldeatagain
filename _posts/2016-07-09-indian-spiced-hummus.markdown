directions: |
  1. If you are using dried chickpeas, make sure you soak them overnight. If you are using canned, drain and wash them in a sieve.
  2. Add the chickpeas to a pot of water seasoned with a bit of salt and cumin powder. Boil them until you can easily mush one between two fingers.
  3. While the chickpeas are boiling, blend whole spices in spice blender together with plenty of ginger and garlic. You can also use a mortar and pestle.
  4. Add a generous amount of olive oil to a pan. Add the spice/garlic/ginger mixture.
  5. Chop the onion and add it to the pan.
  6. Once you've cooked out all the raw flavours of the spice mix, add chili powder, coriander powder, tumeric, and cumin powder. Cook for a few more minutes and turn off the heat.
  7. Put the chickpeas in a food processor, reserving the water. Add a teaspoon or so of miso to the water and stir.
  8. Add masala, lime juice, chopped fresh coriander, a little of the chickpea liquid, and more olive oil if desired.
  9. Blend the mixture until smooth.
  10. Taste. If it's not creamy enough, add olive oil or chickpea liquid. The liquid will be quite salty but you can add more salt if needed.

The secret to amazing hummus is soft chickpeas and just the right blend of salt, spice, fat, and acid. Start by boiling your chickpeas until they are almost falling apart. Some people swear by peeling the chickpeas as well, but I don't think it's necessary – just whatever you do, don't use chickpeas straight from the can.

Most hummus gets its flavour from salt, garlic, sesame paste, and lemon. This recipe changes things up a little with a traditional Indian masala, including a little bit of cooked onion. If you prepare it the way I do and don't add any sesame paste, make sure you use plenty of olive oil. I also like to use just the slightest amount of miso mixed with the water you get from boiling chickpeas, just to add a bit of an umami punch. Weird, I know – but it works really well! I add it to my veggie curries all the time.
