time: 30 min
ingredients:
  - 3 unripe (green) plantains
  - salt
  - paprika
  - sunflower oil
  - 2 avocados
  - 1/4 red onion
  - cilantro

directions: |
  1. Remove the skin from the plantains by scoring the outer ridge and peeling away the skin (this takes some practice).  Chop them into slices, about 1 centimetre thick. The thinner they are, the faster they cook.
  2. Heat a generous amount of oil in a pan on medium-high. Add the plantains to the pan.
  3. When they are nicely golden brown on the bottom, flip them over with some tongs.
  4. When both sides are golden, remove from the oil and drain on some paper towels.
  5. Toss with salt and paprika.
  6. Squish each plantain with the bottom of a cup to give them their flattened shape. Don't squish too hard!
  7. Make the guacamole by mashing together the avocado, slat, finely chopped red onion, and chopped cilantro.
  8. Serve and enjoy

I absolutely love plantains, whether they're sweet, savoury, thick, thin, crunchy or soft. This recipe is based on a Cuban preparation for savoury plaintains called *tostones*, which means "to toast". They are traditionally served with a garlic sauce (if you're interested, check out the recipe for *mojo* on [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/06/sauced-mojo-sauce-condiments-recipe.html)) but I like to make them with a simple guacamole on the side.

The trick to finding the right plantains for this dish is to look for the **green, unripe** ones. When the plantains turn yellow or black, they are better on the bbq or baked and taste sweet.

I try save these for special occasions or when I have company over since they aren't particularly healthy. But when I do make them, damn, do they disappear quickly!
