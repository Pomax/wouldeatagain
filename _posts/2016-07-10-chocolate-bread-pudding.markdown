directions: |
  1. Break up the bread into small chunks (think roughly 2" cubes) and cover with milk and cream to soak and soften 
  2. Once soft, mix in egg, sugar, vanilla, clove, and several tablespoons of cinnamon
  3. Melt half the chocolate with the tablespoon of butter in the microwave on a half-power setting until it's stirrable.
  4. Thoroughly mix molten chocolate into the bread mix
  5. Pour mix in an oven dish so that it sits about an inch below the top of the dish (I find that for 500gr of bread, a 10" x 15" dish works quite well) 
  6. Coarsely crush up the remaining chocolate and sprinkle on top, then gently press down into the mix
  7. Finely dust with cinnamon
  8. Bake at 350F/180C for an hour
  9. Take out of the oven and have it cool down a little.
  10. Either eat as a soft, rich, chocolatey pudding immediately, or...
  11. Wait until cooled down to room temperature, then cover with some kitchen paper towel and aluminium foil and have it compact/cool covered, overnight, then the next day:
  12. Serve as either an amazing alternative to brownies, or serve as dessert with a crème Anglaise, some ice cream, or anything else you like!

It's very tempting to just throw out stale bread, or bread caps, but what if I told you you absolutely shouldn't, and should instead just put them in a bag in the freezer, so that once you accumulate enough of it you can make one of the best desserts of all time?

Chocolate bread pudding is a classic way to "get rid of" old, stale bread, by using it as an ingredient in a delicious pudding recipe. Traditionally served hot out of the oven for a deliciously flavoured, rich, almost molten delight, bread pudding —especially the chocolate variety— can be made even more amazing by having it cool down for a long period of time, giving it time to compact back into an almost pound cake consistency, making it a perfect office snack or easily portioned for dessert. 

It even freezes quite well, keeping for literally months (if packed in an airtight container) and defrosts without a hitch, so trading frozen stale bread for frozen delicious bread cake is well worth it!

Because this is a baking recipe, there are some actual measurements for the ingredients, but they're ratio values: given however much stale bread you're using, use one and a half times as much milk (by weight!), one and a half times as much cream, half as much white sugar, etc. The eggs are a bit of an exception, because portioning eggs by weight is really tricky, so: just round off to whole eggs as you see fit.
