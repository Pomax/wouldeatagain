time: 1 hr
ingredients:
  - 1 can of black beans
  - large onion
  - garlic
  - smoked paprika
  - cayenne pepper
  - chipotle pepper
  - ancho chili pepper
  - kashmiri chili pepper
  - garlic powder
  - canned or fresh tomatoes, diced
  - stock or water
  - sugar, honey, or something else sweet
  - olive oil
  - salt
  - mixed baby salad greens
  - feta cheese, cubed
  - boiled beets, cubed
  - home-made vinaigrette

directions: |
  1. Dice onions finely and add them to some olive oil in a pan. Cook them until they're soft, but not brown.
  2. Add chopped garlic and spices, and mix them into the oil. You may find you need to add more oil for the mixture not to be dry – don't skimp on it!
  3. When the spices are nicely fragrant, wash the beans and add them to the mixture. Then, add the tomatoes and stock or water.
  4. Add salt and sugar/honey/etc. to taste.
  5. Let the beans simmer down until the liquid gets thick. Taste them to see how they are – you may need to add a little more salt or sugar. Sometimes I will add a bit of BBQ sauce or even miso paste to round out the flavour.
  6. When the beans are really soft and almost ready to serve, toss your salad with the vinaigrette, feta, and beats. Season with salt and pepper.
  7. You can eat the beans mixed into the salad or on a side of rice.

When I quit smoking about three years ago (gasp! the horror!), something really unexpected happened to my sense of taste. Whereas before I could eat the *spiciest* foods and not break a sweat, all of a sudden I could hardly handle the slightest bit of heat. What a bummer.

Since I love chilis so much, I spent a lot of time experimenting different with varieties. It turns out that there is *a lot* more to chilis than the Scoville scale – you can get chilis that are smoky, sweet, bitter, and citrusy. Nowadays my taste buds have gotten used to a little more heat again, but I'm glad that I took the time to expand my appreciation.

This recipe combines five of my favourite chili flavours:

- Cayenne, a spicy pepper you probably know;
- Paprika, a mild pepper you also probably know;
- Chipotle, which is dried and smoked Jalapeño;
- Ancho, which is dried Poblano, a mild and darker brown colour
- Kashmiri, which is a medium-hot chili used in Indian cuisine

Of course, you don't have to use all five, and you can sub or add more spices if you feel like it. Enjoy!
