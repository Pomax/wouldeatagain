One of favourite places to go for brunch (or beer) in Toronto is [The Rebel House](http://rebelhouse.ca/) just north of Rosedale station. Their egg dishes, served with kettle fries and salad, are absolutely to die for.

A few months ago they took one of favourites – the "Rosedale Melt – off the menu, so I started cooking it at home. The most important thing about this variation on the Eggs Benedict is to swap hollandaise for a slice of cheese and toast it until it's melted down and a little brown on top. Yum.

I've made a few modifications from the Rebel House's version – the original uses spinach and marinara sauce, and mine uses arugula and cherry tomatoes, but it tastes pretty similar. Hope you enjoy it!

## Ingredients

* Heirloom cherry tomatoes
* Arugula
* Applewood smoked cheddar
* Really fresh eggs
* English muffins
* Salt
* Pepper
* Olive oil
* Balsamic glaze

## Instructions

1. Start boiling some water for the poached the eggs and set your oven to broil on high.
2. Cut your cherry tomatoes in half. Add a splash of olive oil to a small pan, and then add the cherry tomatoes.
3. When the water is close to simmering, turn down the heat. Do the eggs one at a time: crack each egg into a bowl and carefully lower into the water. See [this video from the Food Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66btvAWmp7g) for more detailed instructions about how to do a perfect poached egg. Set aside.
4. Your cherry tomatoes should be nicely blistered by now. Add a handful of arugula to the pan, a bit of balsamic glaze, and turn the heat off.
5. Cut a few slices of applewood smoked cheddar. They don't have to be perfect since they're going to be melted anyway.
6. Place the English muffins on a plate (or a baking sheet, if you're making a lot at once), topping with the arugula/cherry-tomato mixture. Next, add a poached egg, season with salt and pepper, and finally, a slice or two of cheese.
7. Put your plate in the oven. Let it cook until the cheese looks melted and slightly browned.

## Allergens and substitutions

This recipe contains **eggs** and **dairy**.

If you can't cook with those, you could just leave out the eggs/cheese and add a few spoonfuls of mashed avocado and drizzle with more balsamic glaze – I eat it like that probably more often than the original!
