directions: |
  1. Blend the chickpeas, and lentils in a food processor with a bit of olive oil. I kept the mixture pretty coarse so there was still a nice texture to it.
  2. Mash up avocado with a spoon. Add a bit of horse radish if you like it spicy. Mix into the chickpeas/lentils.
  3. Season with a bit of curry power, chipotle pepper powder, salt, pepper, and lemon juice.
  4. Add pea sprouts/greens.
  5. Spread on top of some toasted bread and eat! Yum.

  ## Other ideas

  - If the mixture isn't creamy enough, you could add a bit of Vegenaise or more avocado.
  - Try adding herbs like parsely and dill.

Who doesn't love a good sandwich? This recipe is inspired by Brittany from ilovevegan.com's [lentil-chickpea-salad sandwiches](http://www.ilovevegan.com/lentil-chickpea-salad-sandwiches). My adaptation uses avocado instead of [Vegenaise](http://followyourheart.com/vegenaise-family/) (although Vegenaise is delicious too!), and spices things up with curry powder, chipotle pepper, horse radish, and raw garlic... if you can handle it!

I made this with dark rye bread and broccoli sprouts, but you can definitely get creative with toppings. I'd also recommend toasting the bread.
